# FLIGHT FARE PRICE ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION
•	Developed a machine learning model to predict flight prices using a diverse range of features, including airline, source, destination, and duration.
•	Collected and pre-processed data using PySpark on Azure Databricks, ensuring data quality by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
•	Implemented data visualization using MatPlotLib and seaborn to explore relationships between features and prices, identifying key factors influencing flight costs.
•	Trained multiple machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressor with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy with an R² score of 96.08% after hyperparameter tuning.
